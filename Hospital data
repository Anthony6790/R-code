#e) Which hospital has the lowest number of beds?

#f) Which hospital has the lowest expense?

minrow2 <- hosp %>%

#g) How many hospitals deliver babies?

#h) Using ggplot, scatterplot number of beds vs Total Expense

  geom_point() 

#i) Using ggplot, scatterplot Admissions vs Total Expense

ggplot(hosp, aes(Admissions, Total.Expense))+ 
  geom_point() 

#j) Using dplyr and ggplot, scatterplot beds vs Total Expense
#but only for hospitals that deliver babies

ggplot(Babies, aes(Beds, Total.Expense))+

k) One more question that you believe would be useful.





i. For Pie Chart: One slice should be labeled Admissions.
Choose another attribute for the second slice.

#Admissions. Choose a different attribute for the other
#column.

#ii. The dependent variable should be Total Expense. Choose an
#independent variable from one of the remaining attributes.

ExpAD = lm(Total.Expense~Beds, hosp)

#iii. What is the value of the �!?

#.60
  
#iv. What does the �! measure in this case? ( Hint: Percentage of
#variation in … explained by …)

#approximately 73% of the variance in Total.Expense is explained by Admissions.

#v. What are the pvalues ? How many pvalues are reported, why ?

#2.2e-16, 1 pvalue for one independent variable


#  What does each pvalue mean? (Hint: pvalues have are related to generalizing from the sample to the population: what is the sample
#                               here, what is the population?) (1-2 sentences)

#The Pvalues represent the probability of observing the estimated coefficients or a more extreme value under the assumption of 
#no relationship between the predictor and response variables in the population

#vi. Explain R square, pvalues.

#Pv: There is a direct correlation between the number of admission and the amount of expensises(less than .05)
#R^2: There is significant explanation of variance in expense through admission

#vii. What would be the right attribute size (independent variable) that
#seems most appropriate to lead you in the expense range of $55–
#$75 million?

#If put into an equation around 50 thousand beds would cause you that 
#kind of expense but realistically this is much less considering all the other 
#expenses that will actually go into making a hospital.

#vii. What would be the right attribute size (independent variable) that

#If put into an equation around 200,000 thousand beds and personell would cause you that

#5. Write bullet points explaining your results and why they support your
#conclusion: option A or B?

-#We should build a bigger hospital 
  
-#this is because, beds do not have  a huge impact on expense, admissions do
  
-#More bed also equals more admissions that lower the cost and raise profit margin
